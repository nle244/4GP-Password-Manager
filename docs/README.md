# Documentation 

Package docs go in here. 

## READMEs

Some README files are left in places outside of `docs/` to take advantage of GitHub's [feature](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes). 
Here's a list of links to those files:

- [/README.md](../README.md)
- [/docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) (this documentation)
- [/pm/README.md](../pm/README.md)
